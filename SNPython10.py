#Assignment Description:
"""
Add some randomness to our fight

    Randomize who attacks first
    Randomize how hard someone hits
        Perhaps a random number between 1 and attackPower
    Build in a dodge system
        Perhaps an attack only lands if some random value is higher than the targetâ€™s defense

Add color commentary to the fight so that there is some verbiage based on misses, as well as how hard hits are.
